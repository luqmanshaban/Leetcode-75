![LeetCode Logo](https://leetcode.com/static/images/LeetCode_logo.png)

This repository contains my TypeScript solutions for the [LeetCode 75](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/leetcode-75/) study plan. The LeetCode 75 is a curated list of 75 popular LeetCode problems that cover a wide range of topics and are frequently asked in coding interviews.

Each problem in this repository includes a TypeScript solution along with a detailed explanation. The solutions are organized by problem number in separate files, making it easy to navigate and understand.

Feel free to explore the solutions and explanations for each problem. You can use them as a reference for your own learning or interview preparation. Contributions, suggestions, and improvements are always welcome!

## Prerequisites

To run and test the solutions locally, you need to have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v12 or above)
- TypeScript (v4 or above)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the project:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/leetcode-75-typescript.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd leetcode-75-typescript
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the TypeScript compiler:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. Execute the desired problem solution:

   ```bash
   node dist/problem1.js
   ```

## Folder Structure

The repository has the following folder structure:

```
leetcode-75-typescript/
├── dist/                   # Compiled JavaScript files
├── src/                    # TypeScript source files
│   ├── problem1.ts         # Solution for Problem 1
│   ├── problem2.ts         # Solution for Problem 2
│   ├── ...
│   └── problem75.ts        # Solution for Problem 75
├── .gitignore              # Git ignore file
├── package.json            # Project dependencies and scripts
└── tsconfig.json           # TypeScript configuration
```

Each problem's solution is stored as a separate TypeScript file in the `src/` directory. The compiled JavaScript files are generated in the `dist/` directory using the TypeScript compiler.
